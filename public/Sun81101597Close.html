<p>Sure, here are the steps to rollback to a previous commit both locally and remotely:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Find the commit ID</strong>: Use <code>git log</code> to find the commit ID you want to rollback toÂ¹.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rollback locally</strong>: Use <code>git reset --hard &lt;commit id&gt;</code> to rollback your local repository to the previous commitÂ³. Replace <code>&lt;commit id&gt;</code> with your actual commit IDÂ³.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Force push to remote</strong>: After you've rolled back locally, you can force push to the remote repository with <code>git push --force origin master</code>Â¹. This will overwrite the HEAD in the remote, removing the last commitÂ¹.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that this method will erase everything after your chosen commitÂ³. If you have uncommitted work you want to keep, consider using <code>git stash</code> before resettingÂ².</p>
<p>Also, be aware that force pushing can disrupt the work of others who have cloned or forked your repository. If others have already pulled the repo, consider using <code>git revert</code> to create a new commit that undoes the changes of the previous commit, then push this new commitÂ¹. This way, you don't rewrite the historyÂ¹.</p>
<p>Remember to replace <code>&lt;commit id&gt;</code> with your actual commit IDÂ³. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š</p>
